Code written by: Clone

How to start: 
  • Boot up your own python enviornment, conda, wing101, and etc. (I recomend a cloud 
    service such as 'Python Anywhere' or a Rasperry Pi (any so that you do not have to keep 
    your computer on while the code executes)
  • Simply execute the code from your chosen compiler once you have opened the file.
How to start from terminal:
  • Be sure you have Python 3.7 installed onto your desired machine.
    If you do not have python isnstalled, 
    Simply run the command: sudo apt-get install python3.7 
    (or sudo apt-get install python3, should work the same in the end).
  • Navigate to the directory your .py file has been installed (or specify its location in the command line)
    and execute the command: python3.7 bot69.py (or python3 bot69.py)
    
That's it! Enjoy your 'nice' bot ;)

Please feel free to download and change up the code if you wish your bot to tweet something other than just the word 'nice'.

It is worth noting that twitter does not like repeat tweets from bots. So I had to make it delete its own tweet right before 
a new one was pushed out. I've thought of a work around but I have not implemented it into the code just yet. Will be sure to
do so at some point. In the meantime...enjoy!
